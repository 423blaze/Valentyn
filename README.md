## FOLIO

[Live Demo](https://ayushsingh.co.in/)

To cater to my goal of having my own portfolio website since 2016 ðŸš€

## How did I create this?

1. UI/UX is brainstormed using inspiration from winning portfolios from awwwards. High-fidelity mockup aggregating the ideas using Figma.
2. This project uses React for simplicity to break down sections as components. Also uses next.js to achieve SSG. SVGs have been animated using CSS.
3. Section scrolling and reveal animations uses GSAP. Card interactions use Tilt js. The timeline section was built using JS/SVGs and animated via GSAP.
4. Optimised animations, layer management, repaints, and re-layouts using Chrome dev tools.

## How to run on local?

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

I have been refining the project using 7+ years of my learnings. While I appreciate the beauty of open source, due credits to the project will be appreciated if you plan to re-share the template. Copyright headers with author name should be included under the forked versions as well. Happy coding :)
